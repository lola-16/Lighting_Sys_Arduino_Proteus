# Lighting_Sys_Arduino_Proteus
This project likely involves an Arduino-based lighting system designed and simulated within the Proteus software environment. The repository probably contains the Arduino code (.ino files), the Proteus schematic (.pdsprj or similar), and potentially any libraries or additional files needed for the simulation. The system's functionality and complexity would be detailed within the project's documentation (likely the README file itself).
