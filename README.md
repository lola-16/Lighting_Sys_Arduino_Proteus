# Lighting_Sys_Arduino_Proteus
This project likely involves an Arduino-based lighting system designed and simulated within the Proteus 8 professional software environment. The repository contains the Arduino code (.ino files), the Proteus schematic (.pdsprj).
To run:
Open the Proteus Project: Open the appropriate Proteus project file (.pdsprj) that contains the circuit schematic for the lighting system.
Locate the Arduino Uno: In the Proteus schematic, find the Arduino Uno microcontroller.
Load the Arduino Code (Hex File):
Double-click on the Arduino Uno component.
A dialog box will appear. Look for the "Program File" property.
Click the folder icon to browse for the Arduino code file. You need to select the compiled hex file (.hex).
Run the Simulation: Click the "Play" button in Proteus to start the simulation. The lighting system should begin to operate as programmed.
